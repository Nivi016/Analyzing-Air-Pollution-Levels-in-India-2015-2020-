                             Introduction to Air Pollution Levels in India (2015-2020) Data
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize air quality data for Indian cities, specifically focusing on the particular city , using Power BI. Air pollution is a major concern, and understanding the levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2, and AQI (Air Quality Index) helps to assess environmental health risks and develop strategies to improve air quality.

The dataset used includes air quality parameters such as PM2.5, NO,NO2,NOx, CO, SO2, O3, and other volatile organic compounds (e.g., Benzene, Toluene,Xylene). Additionally, it provides the Air Quality Index (AQI) and corresponding air quality bucket classifications (e.g. good,Moderate, Poor,severe). Using this data, a dashboard is created to visualize trends, distributions, and comparisons over time.


                              Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

* Data Visualization:
   * Create a dashboard to visualize air quality data and trends using Power BI.
   * Trend Analysis: Analyze the trends of various pollutants (PM2.5, NO,NO2, NOx,CO,SO2, O3etc.) over time.
* AQI Classification: Understand the distribution of AQI buckets (e.g., good,Moderate, Poor,sereve) for different dates and pollutants.
* Correlation Study: Identify relationships and correlations between various pollutants (e.g., NO2 vs SO2).
* City-Specific Insights: Focus on each particular city in future, and work on potentially scale 


                              Tasks
  
* Data collection and preparing
   * Acquired air quality dataset with key pollutant indicators such as PM2.5, NO, NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, AQI, and AQI bucket.
   * Cleaned the data in terms of missing values,replaced null values,set column header, Blank column remove and structured it to work seamlessly in Power BI.

* Data Import into Power BI-
   * Imported the dataset into Power BI and performed data transformations where necessary, ensuring date formats, numerical values, and text fields were correctly structured.

* Data Visualization:
  Created various visualizations to represent the air quality data:
   * Line Charts: Showing Year data for pollutant trends.
   * Bar Charts: Representing AQI values across different dates or Pollutant values across different dates ,cities.
   * Pie Charts: Illustrating the distribution of AQI bucket classifications (Moderate, Poor).
   * Scatter Plots: Used to study correlations between pollutants (e.g., NO2 vs SO2).
   * Ribbon Chart: we visualize each  Pollutants values across cities with AQ Bucket  .
   * Map Visualizations: Providing geographical insights (potentially for future extension).

* Combined all visualizations into an interactive Power BI dashboard.
* Added filters (slicers) to allow users to interact with the data by date, city, or AQI bucket.


                                  Outcomes
  
The outcomes of this project include:
* Interactive Dashboard: A fully functional Power BI dashboard showing visual insights into air quality data.
* Pollutant Trend Analysis: A detailed trend analysis of various air pollutants over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns, peaks, and troughs.
* AQI Bucket Distribution: Visual representation of AQI buckets (Moderate, Poor) across different periods, helping to understand when air quality is most impacted.
* Pollutant Correlation: Insights into how different pollutants relate to one another (e.g., relationship between NO2 and SO2 levels).
* User-Friendly Experience: The dashboard is intuitive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific time periods, pollutants, or AQI levels.

                                Challenges
  
Several challenges were encountered during the project:
* Data Quality Issues: Missing or inconsistent data (e.g., gaps in pollutant readings on certain dates) required data cleaning efforts.
* Complexity of Time Series Analysis: Handling date formats and ensuring accurate time series trends for pollutants were challenging, especially when dealing with hourly or daily data.
* Correlation Misinterpretation: Some pollutants may show spurious correlations due to external factors (e.g., weather, season), requiring careful interpretation of results.
* Data Visualization: Choosing the right type of visualizations to effectively communicate insights, as different pollutants behave differently over time.

                                Final report

* Dashboard Overview: Screenshots of the Power BI dashboard, with explanations of the key insights and how to interact with the visualizations.
* Interpretation of Findings: Insights gained from the dashboard (e.g., periods of high AQI, correlations between NO2 and SO2).
* Recommendations: Suggestions for further study, such as incorporating additional cities, weather data, or exploring health impacts.


                                 Conclusion
  
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into air quality trends in each city, visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The key findings highlight periods of poor air quality, correlations between pollutants, and the overall AQI distribution. While the project faced challenges related to data quality and complex analysis, it successfully delivered a tool that can assist policymakers and environmentalists in monitoring and improving air quality.
Future steps include expanding the analysis to cover other cities, integrating external factors (like weather), and adding real-time data for continuous monitoring.
